## Sample Solution:

## Keypoints:

Initialize the TextToSpeech Object:
```Java
private void initializeTTS() {
        tts = new TextToSpeech(this, new TextToSpeech.OnInitListener() {
            @Override
            public void onInit(int status) {
                ttsLoaded = true;
            }
        });
    }
```

Load the phrases from text file:
```Java
   private void loadPhrases(){
        ESLPhrases = new ArrayList<String>();
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(getResources().openRawResource(R.raw.phrases));
        while (scan.hasNextLine()) {
            String line = scan.nextLine();
            ESLPhrases.add(line);
        }
        Log.d(DEBUG_TAG, "ESLPhrases.size() = " + ESLPhrases.size() );
    }
  ```
  
Set-up the ListView:
```Java
  private void setupListView(){
        ListView lv = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.alphabetlistview);
        ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<>(
                this, R.layout.my_list_item, ESLPhrases);
        lv.setAdapter(adapter);

        // Set up event listening for clicks on the list
        lv.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View view, int index, long id) {
                handleClick(index);
            }
        });
    }
```

Handle the clicks:
```Java
    private void handleClick(int index) {
        String text = ESLPhrases.get(index);
        if (ttsLoaded) {
            tts.setSpeechRate(0.6f); // 1.0f - Normal speed
            tts.speak(text, TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH, null);
        }
    }
```
